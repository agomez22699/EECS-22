We begin our journey through Homework 3 by decomposing the file given to us at the begining of the assingment. Here we seperated the assignment into FileIO, DIPs, Advanced, and the original file.

Each were further seperated into .h and .c file respectively.

in the .h files, these files were made into header files as demonstrated in the slides.

in the .c files, these files contained the functions that were declared in the orginal file, so these were just pasted into the respective files.

in the makefile, here we basically compiled all the gcc, debug, .o , and header files to compile and link all the different sections of the code that were seperated. 

in the Advanced.h, we basically made the unique header file for the new photo filters that were specifically assigned for this assignment.

in the Advanced.c, we were unable to complete the filter(s), so instead we placed print statements to prevent any compiling errors that may arise from an empty function.

in the PhotoLab section, we added the debug auto statement using the ifdef DEBUG example with autotest and goto in this statement. Here we used goto to skip the rest of the file and head towards the end of program. 
	in the rest of this file, there has been tweaks to portions of the code to adjust to the homework 3 assignment. For instance, adding more cases in the switch statement, the autotest, and various niche areas of the code.

All in all, that was essentially the entireity of the assignment.
