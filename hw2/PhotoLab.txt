We begin with first including variables on top of our main to be used in the program while running. This is self explanatory and necessary for the program. 

Next, we created a switch statement in the main to make the test cases for each input simpler rather than doing a bunch of if statements.

After the switch statement, we worked on the Black and White Filter. Here we basically added a temp variable to store the values and assign to the new arrays.

In hue, we essentially converted degrees to radians, checked the values of the new rgbs and checked if they were in range with if statements.

In Sharpen, we made temp arrays to store old values and used for loops to assign the variables. 

Auto test, we just made the functions in the other function.
