In this assignment, we essentially built upon the dynamic memory of the photolab to then use linked lists to use a movie to apply filters on each and every frame while also doing some algorithms to help.

	for instance, with these liked list, its essentially creating multiple folders to hold the content of the frames that its using, either or RBG or YUV.
		This was utilized in the ImageList module.
	in the DIPs module, its essentially the same as creating the filters from the last homework assignments. 
		For instance black and white, hue, but reverse is new

	in the iterative module, it essentially creates a sequence of frames for the movie
	
	in the movie module, it described the movie structure and assigned functions

	and MovieLab as the main module.


	As mentioned in the mandatory survey, due to other stressors in my life, I was not able to fully complete this homework assignment,
		the modules that have been completed are
				ImageList
				Makefile

	thank you for understanding and an amazing quarter..
